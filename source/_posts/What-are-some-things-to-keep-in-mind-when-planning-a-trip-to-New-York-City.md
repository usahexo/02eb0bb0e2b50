Also, be sure to budget appropriately. New York is one of the most expensive cities in the world, so you'll want to make sure you have enough money to cover your expenses.

Finally, try to plan your trip during a time when there aren't any major events going on. New York can get very crowded during popular tourist seasons and major events like Comic-Con or the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.

#  Is there anything else visitors should know before travelling to New York City?
